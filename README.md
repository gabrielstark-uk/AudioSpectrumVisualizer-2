## Visual Studio Code Required to run the repo ##

# It has implememted an RF Chip Detector which will be deactivated once it reaches over 90% detection 

 As a countermeasure, I hope you like 'Macarena'. Your attackers would love this app. 

 Enjoy a peacefull life once you loaded this into Visual Studio Code. You deserve it. #
